## My process

In building this Planets page, I followed the following steps:

1. **Planning**: I started by brainstorming and gathering ideas for the design and functionality of the page. I sketched out a rough layout and identified the key features I wanted to include.

2. **Setting up the Project**: I initialized a new ReactJS project using Vite, a fast build tool. This allowed me to set up the project quickly with a modern development environment.

3. **Creating Components**: I designed and implemented the necessary components to build the Planets page. I used ReactJS along with styled-components for styling and Framer Motion API for animations and interactivity.

4. **Fetching Data**: I retrieved data about the planets, their internal structure, and surface geology from reliable sources. I organized and structured the data in a way that can be easily consumed by the components.

5. **Building the UI**: I designed and styled the user interface using HTML5, CSS, and styled-components. I focused on creating a visually appealing and responsive layout that effectively presents the information about the Planets system.

6. **Implementing Interactivity**: I added interactivity to the page using JavaScript and ReactJS. I integrated Framer Motion API to create smooth animations and transitions for interactive elements such as buttons.

7. **Testing and Debugging**: I thoroughly tested the page across different devices and browsers to ensure its compatibility and responsiveness. I debugged any issues or inconsistencies that arose during testing.

8. **Documentation**: Finally, I documented the project, including this README.md file, to provide clear instructions on how to run the project locally and any additional information or acknowledgments.

Throughout the process, I maintained version control using Git, committing changes at logical stages and creating branches as needed.

Feel free to adapt or modify this process description to reflect your actual workflow and the specific steps you took in building the Planets page.
